# Maps from #30DayMapChallenge

These are maps I created during **#30DayMapChallenge** in collaboration with **Next Generation Cartographers**.  
The repository contains **PNG images of my maps**, visualizing different themes with classical cartography techniques, including hachures for an old-map feel.

## Maps Included

### Day 8 – Urban: Noise
**Studying in These Decibels?**  
A map of noise levels around a university campus area, visualizing the intensity of urban sounds and where quiet or noisy spots occur.

### Day 15 – Fire: Mount Merapi
**The Volcanic Hazard Zones**  
A map of Mount Merapi, focusing on the Sleman side, showing volcanic hazard zones. The high-risk areas (Zone 1) stretch like tentacles along rivers, while Zones 2 and 3 form the rounded bell. Hazard data is from **BNPB Indonesia**. The jellyfish shape gives a visual sense of scale, enhanced with a fun comparison to 50 of the world’s largest jellyfish.
